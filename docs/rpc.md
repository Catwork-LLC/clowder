# RPC

Actors, Learners, Environments may distributed across processes and machines. We use RPC to communicate between these processes. We try to make this deep learning framework agnostic. But right now, I uses Moolib(a library for distributed ML training with PyTorch) to define and test a set of APIs. The backend may change in the future.

An `RPC` object calls remote function or accepts remote function from other `RPC` object. In convention, we call the caller `client` and the callee `server`. Because the `server` `RPC` object provides a remote function to be called, it also has the name `service`.

## Launchable

`Launchable` is a interface that defines `init_launcher` and `init_execution` methods.

## Remotable

`RemotableMeta` is a metaclass that automatically mark methods in a class as remote functions if they have the `__remote__` attribute set to True, and collects all remote method names into a list in the `__remote_methods__` attribute of the class. It creates a set called `remote_methods` and populates it with any methods defined in the `__remote_methods__` attribute in the class and any of its base classes. Any method has the `__remote__` attribute set to `True` also be added to the set.

## Worker

`Worker` is an interface for (potentially) distributed workers. Each worker is a subprocess.

```python
class SimpleWorker(Worker):
    def run(self):
        print("Meow, ðŸ˜»")

worker = Worker()
worker.start() # spwan a subprocess with target=run
```

## Handle

`Handle` is an interface for `Worker`. `handle.dereference()` will return the worker object. We mainly use the handle to call remote functions on another worker.
